# Week 7 Lab Report: CSE Labs Done Quick

##### Initial Setup:
Before doing anything, I set up an ssh key on my IENG 6 machine so that it would be easy to login (without having to type in my password everytime).
I also connected by IENG6 machine to my github account via SSH so that I don't have to provide autentication.

### Step 1: Delete existing forks of the repository
