# Week 5 Lab Report: Researching Commands

I chose to research the 'less' command. I will be exploring how we can use it in four different ways.

### Opening a file with the 'less' command

Reference Used: [How To Geek Reference](https://www.howtogeek.com/444233/how-to-use-the-less-command-on-linux/)

The 'less' command can be used to open and read the contents of a file. The benefit is that less will open the file within the terminal, however, it does so in a new page, so you won't be able to see the commands that were run. Here are examples of how less works after cd'ing into the right directory:

```
//Input

//Output (Note: a lot of text has been omitted as there is a lot of text in the chapter)

When people consider the U.S. apparel industry, they often think of New York City<E2><80><99>s Seventh Avenue, which is driven by new design, constantly changing seasonal offerings, and a willingness by consumers to pay a premium for the cutting edge of fashion. New York City and Los Angeles continue to have a competitive advantage in this area because a large number of designers and manufacturers are located in these cities and can respond quickly to changing demands, as well as shape them. This infrastructure allows for <E2><80><9C>quick response<E2><80><9D> on the fashion end of the women<E2><80><99>s and, to a more limited extent, men<E2><80><99>s markets. Once established, a variety of proponents believe, the experience at the fashion end can be diffused downward to less fashion-oriented products. As a result, some of the fashion-oriented products that had been sourced offshore can then return to the United States.

Finally, Chapter 15 (<E2><80><9C>Information-Integrated Channels<E2><80><9D>) touches on a number of public policy issues raised by our findings. These include what can be done about the continuing problem of sweatshops, the new international economics of trade, and the effect of information integration on the business cycle and consumer prices at the macroeconomic level. Last but not least, we take a realistic look at the competitive future of the U.S. retail, apparel, and textile industries.
The information-integrated channel, with its emphasis on time and product perishability, is the basis for our cautiously optimistic<E2><80><94>and unconventional<E2><80><94>outlook. Even more important, the forces examined in this book provide a glimpse into processes reshaping a considerable portion of the economy. Consumers no longer line up for a special suit at a store like Bond Stores; they also expect an ever more <E2><80><9C>fashionable<E2><80><9D> array of cereal products, computers, and automobiles. As the next chapter shows, the changes now under way have their roots in new technologies, just as technical advances in transportation and communication shifted the industrial landscape at the end of the last century.

Although not a trained folklorist, Arnold Rojas writes of the vaquero (cowboy) culture of California, especially in the San Joaquin Valley at the turn of the century and into the first third of the 1900s. He describes the life of the Mexican vaqueros, how their lives were spent working on large ranches like the Tejon Ranch and the Kern County Land Co. Their lives were very narrowly focused on cattle and ranch life and they all spoke mostly Spanish. In his reminiscences of vaquero culture and of the impact Mexican Sonorans had on California, Rojas shows a side of Chicano culture not commonly known. Born in California, where his mother and grandmother were also born, it is clear he loved the life he lived. He writes of La Llorona and Joaqu<C3><AD>n Murrieta, and of Tiburcio V<C3><A1>squez, who once gave food to his grandmother and mother when they were fleeing from the gringos in Los Angeles.
There are no overall written accounts or collections of the oral traditions and folklore of the early Californios as we have of the Hispanos of New Mexico. In Angustias de la Guerra, Ord<E2><80><99>s Occurrences in Hispanic California, she describes some customs, but her work was not intended to preserve for history the way of life of the Californios. Glimpses of customs, games, dances, theater, and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western travelers, although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context. Spanish-language newspapers from the late nineteenth century exhibit folk customs and traditions. The folklore collected from Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the twentieth century, even if it<E2><80><99>s from a third- or fourth-generation Chicano, generally will be folklore from Mexico transplanted to California since the turn of the century by immigrants fleeing a revolutionary war, or those coming to work in the agriculture fields. Of course it could also originate in New Mexico or Texas, since there has been much migration into California by Chicanos from those states. Folktales, jests, folk songs, corridos (ballads), and customs related to religious and secular holidays, foods, and other folk traditions found in contemporary California will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern states and with Mexico. Chicano students have taken an active interest in folklore in the last twenty years, and archives established at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles hold growing collections of many genres of Mexican American folklore. There are published collections from the 1970s and 1980s of folk medicine rituals and folk narratives collected primarily from Mexican immigrants in the Los Angeles area, but there is still much fieldwork to be done in this area.

The place where Chicanos and Mexicanos bury their dead is called a camposanto, a <E2><80><9C>holy field<E2><80><9D> or <E2><80><9C>field of the saints.<E2><80><9D> Although some people use the better-known term cementerio, meaning <E2><80><9C>cemetery,<E2><80><9D> camposanto is a word still used in many families. Interestingly, some Spanish dictionaries define the word as a <E2><80><9C>cemetery for Catholics,<E2><80><9D> whereas they define cementerio as an <E2><80><9C>enclosed place for burying the dead.<E2><80><9D>
Camposantos are important in Chicano families, and the concept of death is always present in personal narratives, songs, and in the religious holy days observed. El D<C3><AD>a de los Muertos, or All Souls<E2><80><99> Day, is a religious and folk holy day that is devoutly celebrated; it usually includes a visit to the cemetery. The family cleans the grave sites of loved ones, sets up flowers and candles, and visits with and prays for the departed. During the rest of the year, attendance to burial sites does not diminish, and graves are kept decorated and colorful.
During the colonial period of New Spain, burials were made within the church itself, as was the tradition in medieval Spain. Spaniards and the clergy were allowed to be buried in the missionary churches, whereas the mestizos (people of mixed race) and Indians were buried in the camposanto located in front or to the right of the church. By the late eighteenth century, the Catholic Church forbade additional burials inside churches, supposedly for public health reasons, but the ricos, the well-to-do, continued to buy their way into the churches. So the camposantos were still left for the poor mestizos. A recognizable sign of a colonial frontier camposanto was a large public, eight-foot wooden cross that stood in the front or center of the cemetery. Some can still be found today in rural parts of northern New Mexico and Texas. Another feature that can also still be found in parts of the Southwest is segregation and isolation from Anglo cemeteries. Many were located side by side but were fenced off and had separate entrances. The sites chosen for rural camposantos were often on tierra muerta, barren land that was too poor to cultivate.
Cemetery and graveyard decorating traditions have been researched and written about as a means of appreciating and understanding Mexican folk beliefs about death and grieving. The adornment of grave sites reflects religious folk practices, and ethnic and family attitudes about death and remembrance. Some of the customs include decorating and designing a space that will be revisited by a family for many generations. The intent is to keep the deceased person alive in the family<E2><80><99>s memory. Some design motifs that are distinctive to Chicano cemeteries are the construction and design of crosses. Terry Jordan<E2><80><99>s book has an illustration of twelve different <E2><80><9C>subtypes of wooden Latin crosses found on Mexican graves in Texas<E2><80><9D> (78). In the nineteenth and even into the twentieth century crosses were built of wood, but these didn<E2><80><99>t last long, being destroyed either by the elements or by vandalism. More common today are crosses made of molded concrete. Many grave sites have a cerquito, a low wood, metal, or concrete fence, an enclosure that surrounds an individual grave. Another common trait is to construct a cement grave marker, with a nicho (niche) built into it, so that the statue of a saint, La Virgen de Guadalupe, or a photograph of the deceased can be placed in it. Sometimes a concrete cross will have a nicho built into its base for the same purpose. Although fresh flowers are often placed at grave sites, paper and plastic flowers are more common. Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross. Another dis-tinguishing feature in Chicano camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave. As with home yard shrines and home altars, everyday objects are used as personal and artistic statements. It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that people create folklore, folk art, and folk music.
Many grave markers are brightly painted, and some even have religious scenes painted on them. This tradition has been linked to Mexico<E2><80><99>s indigenous heritage, for, as Terry Jordan states, <E2><80><9C>Such use of color in a sacred context has ample pre-Columbian precedent in Mexico, where even the huge pyramids once bore bright paints<E2><80><9D> (80). He goes on to say, <E2><80><9C>Hispanic graveyards are places of color, where paints, flowers, and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo<E2><80><9D> (88).

In these examples, after cd'ing into the right directory, the less command is able to open the file called ch1.txt and chC.txt to display all the text within that file. It does so in an editor that makes it relatively easy to navigate between lines. This is useful if we want to see the file without having to open it through the OS's GUI, especially if we were already in the terminal.
