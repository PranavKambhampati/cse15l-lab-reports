# Week 5 Lab Report: Researching Commands

I chose to research the 'less' command. I will be exploring how we can use it in four different ways.

### Opening a file with the 'less' command

Reference Used: [How To Geek Reference](https://www.howtogeek.com/444233/how-to-use-the-less-command-on-linux/)

The 'less' command can be used to open and read the contents of a file. The benefit is that less will open the file within the terminal, however, it does so in a new page, so you won't be able to see the commands that were run. Here are examples of how less works after cd'ing into the right directory:

```
//Input

//Output (Note: a lot of text has been omitted as there is a lot of text in the chapter)

When people consider the U.S. apparel industry, they often think of New York City<E2><80><99>s Seventh Avenue, which is driven by new design, constantly changing seasonal offerings, and a willingness by consumers to pay a premium for the cutting edge of fashion. New York City and Los Angeles continue to have a competitive advantage in this area because a large number of designers and manufacturers are located in these cities and can respond quickly to changing demands, as well as shape them. This infrastructure allows for <E2><80><9C>quick response<E2><80><9D> on the fashion end of the women<E2><80><99>s and, to a more limited extent, men<E2><80><99>s markets. Once established, a variety of proponents believe, the experience at the fashion end can be diffused downward to less fashion-oriented products. As a result, some of the fashion-oriented products that had been sourced offshore can then return to the United States.

Finally, Chapter 15 (<E2><80><9C>Information-Integrated Channels<E2><80><9D>) touches on a number of public policy issues raised by our findings. These include what can be done about the continuing problem of sweatshops, the new international economics of trade, and the effect of information integration on the business cycle and consumer prices at the macroeconomic level. Last but not least, we take a realistic look at the competitive future of the U.S. retail, apparel, and textile industries.
The information-integrated channel, with its emphasis on time and product perishability, is the basis for our cautiously optimistic<E2><80><94>and unconventional<E2><80><94>outlook. Even more important, the forces examined in this book provide a glimpse into processes reshaping a considerable portion of the economy. Consumers no longer line up for a special suit at a store like Bond Stores; they also expect an ever more <E2><80><9C>fashionable<E2><80><9D> array of cereal products, computers, and automobiles. As the next chapter shows, the changes now under way have their roots in new technologies, just as technical advances in transportation and communication shifted the industrial landscape at the end of the last century.

Although not a trained folklorist, Arnold Rojas writes of the vaquero (cowboy) culture of California, especially in the San Joaquin Valley at the turn of the century and into the first third of the 1900s. He describes the life of the Mexican vaqueros, how their lives were spent working on large ranches like the Tejon Ranch and the Kern County Land Co. Their lives were very narrowly focused on cattle and ranch life and they all spoke mostly Spanish. In his reminiscences of vaquero culture and of the impact Mexican Sonorans had on California, Rojas shows a side of Chicano culture not commonly known. Born in California, where his mother and grandmother were also born, it is clear he loved the life he lived. He writes of La Llorona and Joaqu<C3><AD>n Murrieta, and of Tiburcio V<C3><A1>squez, who once gave food to his grandmother and mother when they were fleeing from the gringos in Los Angeles.
There are no overall written accounts or collections of the oral traditions and folklore of the early Californios as we have of the Hispanos of New Mexico. In Angustias de la Guerra, Ord<E2><80><99>s Occurrences in Hispanic California, she describes some customs, but her work was not intended to preserve for history the way of life of the Californios. Glimpses of customs, games, dances, theater, and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western travelers, although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context. Spanish-language newspapers from the late nineteenth century exhibit folk customs and traditions. The folklore collected from Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the twentieth century, even if it<E2><80><99>s from a third- or fourth-generation Chicano, generally will be folklore from Mexico transplanted to California since the turn of the century by immigrants fleeing a revolutionary war, or those coming to work in the agriculture fields. Of course it could also originate in New Mexico or Texas, since there has been much migration into California by Chicanos from those states. Folktales, jests, folk songs, corridos (ballads), and customs related to religious and secular holidays, foods, and other folk traditions found in contemporary California will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern states and with Mexico. Chicano students have taken an active interest in folklore in the last twenty years, and archives established at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles hold growing collections of many genres of Mexican American folklore. There are published collections from the 1970s and 1980s of folk medicine rituals and folk narratives collected primarily from Mexican immigrants in the Los Angeles area, but there is still much fieldwork to be done in this area.

The place where Chicanos and Mexicanos bury their dead is called a camposanto, a <E2><80><9C>holy field<E2><80><9D> or <E2><80><9C>field of the saints.<E2><80><9D> Although some people use the better-known term cementerio, meaning <E2><80><9C>cemetery,<E2><80><9D> camposanto is a word still used in many families. Interestingly, some Spanish dictionaries define the word as a <E2><80><9C>cemetery for Catholics,<E2><80><9D> whereas they define cementerio as an <E2><80><9C>enclosed place for burying the dead.<E2><80><9D>
Camposantos are important in Chicano families, and the concept of death is always present in personal narratives, songs, and in the religious holy days observed. El D<C3><AD>a de los Muertos, or All Souls<E2><80><99> Day, is a religious and folk holy day that is devoutly celebrated; it usually includes a visit to the cemetery. The family cleans the grave sites of loved ones, sets up flowers and candles, and visits with and prays for the departed. During the rest of the year, attendance to burial sites does not diminish, and graves are kept decorated and colorful.
During the colonial period of New Spain, burials were made within the church itself, as was the tradition in medieval Spain. Spaniards and the clergy were allowed to be buried in the missionary churches, whereas the mestizos (people of mixed race) and Indians were buried in the camposanto located in front or to the right of the church. By the late eighteenth century, the Catholic Church forbade additional burials inside churches, supposedly for public health reasons, but the ricos, the well-to-do, continued to buy their way into the churches. So the camposantos were still left for the poor mestizos. A recognizable sign of a colonial frontier camposanto was a large public, eight-foot wooden cross that stood in the front or center of the cemetery. Some can still be found today in rural parts of northern New Mexico and Texas. Another feature that can also still be found in parts of the Southwest is segregation and isolation from Anglo cemeteries. Many were located side by side but were fenced off and had separate entrances. The sites chosen for rural camposantos were often on tierra muerta, barren land that was too poor to cultivate.
Cemetery and graveyard decorating traditions have been researched and written about as a means of appreciating and understanding Mexican folk beliefs about death and grieving. The adornment of grave sites reflects religious folk practices, and ethnic and family attitudes about death and remembrance. Some of the customs include decorating and designing a space that will be revisited by a family for many generations. The intent is to keep the deceased person alive in the family<E2><80><99>s memory. Some design motifs that are distinctive to Chicano cemeteries are the construction and design of crosses. Terry Jordan<E2><80><99>s book has an illustration of twelve different <E2><80><9C>subtypes of wooden Latin crosses found on Mexican graves in Texas<E2><80><9D> (78). In the nineteenth and even into the twentieth century crosses were built of wood, but these didn<E2><80><99>t last long, being destroyed either by the elements or by vandalism. More common today are crosses made of molded concrete. Many grave sites have a cerquito, a low wood, metal, or concrete fence, an enclosure that surrounds an individual grave. Another common trait is to construct a cement grave marker, with a nicho (niche) built into it, so that the statue of a saint, La Virgen de Guadalupe, or a photograph of the deceased can be placed in it. Sometimes a concrete cross will have a nicho built into its base for the same purpose. Although fresh flowers are often placed at grave sites, paper and plastic flowers are more common. Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross. Another dis-tinguishing feature in Chicano camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave. As with home yard shrines and home altars, everyday objects are used as personal and artistic statements. It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that people create folklore, folk art, and folk music.
Many grave markers are brightly painted, and some even have religious scenes painted on them. This tradition has been linked to Mexico<E2><80><99>s indigenous heritage, for, as Terry Jordan states, <E2><80><9C>Such use of color in a sacred context has ample pre-Columbian precedent in Mexico, where even the huge pyramids once bore bright paints<E2><80><9D> (80). He goes on to say, <E2><80><9C>Hispanic graveyards are places of color, where paints, flowers, and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo<E2><80><9D> (88).

In these examples, after cd'ing into the right directory, the less command is able to open the file called ch1.txt and chC.txt to display all the text within that file. It does so in an editor that makes it relatively easy to navigate between lines. This is useful if we want to see the file without having to open it through the OS's GUI, especially if we were already in the terminal.


### Option 1: Viewing Line Numbers with less

Reference Used: [How To Geek Reference](https://www.howtogeek.com/444233/how-to-use-the-less-command-on-linux/)

Even though less opens the text file in a really simple editor, with the default being no-line numbers for each line, we can actually pass in a parameter into the command that allows for line numbers.

      5 Cabeza de Baca, Fabiola (1894<E2><80><93>1991)
      6 Born in northern New Mexico on May 16, 1894 (although some sources give her birth date as 1898), Fabiola Cabeza de Baca became a famous home economist, teacher, folklorist, and writer. She was one of several New Mexican women, such as Cleofas M. Jaramillo and Ni      6 na Otero-Warren, who wrote of the culture and heritage of their Hispano ancestors. Her parents came from long-established Hispano families who had been in New Mexico for over 200 years. Her grandparents raised her from the age of four, after her mother died, lea      6 ving Fabiola with one brother and two sisters. She attended the Loretto Academy in Las Vegas and after graduating from high school became a teacher in a rural area six miles from her father<E2><80><99>s ranch in La Liendre. In 1921 she received a B.A. degree fro      6 m New Mexico Normal (now New Mexico Highlands University) and in 1929 a B.S. in home economics from New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now New Mexico State University). In between she also spent one year studying in Spain.
      7 For over thirty years she worked as an extension agent, teaching the traditional ways of preparing foods and emphasizing the nutritional value in the native diet. Two of her books, Historic Cookery and The Good Life, depict the way of life of the Hispanos in the      7  late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In We Fed Them Cactus she presents a biography and ethnography of her family, especially her grandmother, a strong woman and a curandera, and retells the stories narrated to her by her father. She depicts the arriv      7 al of the Hispano pioneers on the llano (plains) of western New Mexico in the 1830s, and also that of the Anglos in the 1880s, the loss of land, the fencing-in of the plains, and the end of the era with the death of her father. The title of the book refers to th      7 e custom in New Mexico of feeding cattle cactus to keep them alive during droughts. In The Good Life, not a long book, Cabeza de Baca creates a fictional family, the Turrietas, and uses their story to narrate the rituals, customs, food, and culture of New Mexico      7 . The customs of Christmas, Lent, marriage, and a funeral are presented, along with many recipes of the foods prepared for these celebrations. She wrote many articles for various New Mexican publications. In 1959 she retired but continued to work giving lectures      7 , writing, and acting as a consultant to the Peace Corps. She died at the age of ninety-seven on October 14, 1991.
      8 Genaro Padilla refers to her writing as <E2><80><9C>folkloric autobiography,<E2><80><9D> a significant genre, since it is one of the few kinds of writing by Hispanos that depicts the life they either experienced or learned from their ancestors at the turn of the      8  century. Her folkloric work is extremely important because she wrote about women and how their complicated and elaborate daily work so profoundly maintained the culture and traditions of the Hispanos. Cabeza de Baca was an active member of many community organi      8 zations and was president in 1955 of the New Mexico Folklore Society.

     10 Calavera (Skeleton)
     11 A bony skeleton and/or the skull of a skeleton. The calavera has become the symbol of the downtrodden, who must laugh at life in order to survive it. It is also used to mean a drunkard or a very stupid person. During the celebrations of the holy day D<C3><AD>a d     11 e los Muertos, candy skulls are made and sold in bakeries throughout Mexico and the United States. These skulls may be placed on home altars or given as gifts to children, family, and friends. The Mexican artist and printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada started drawi     11 ng calaveras during the late nineteenth century to coincide with this holiday. Their popularity is primarily attributed to him and his work. His images of calaveras have been reproduced thousands of times and can be found year-round, but especially during celebr     11 ations of D<C3><AD>a de los Muertos. Posada printed many calaveras during the period of the presidency of Porfirio D<C3><AD>az and during the Mexican Revolution. He introduced the humorous satirical calavera that showed the objectionable side of life, that engag     11 ed in regular daily activities such as eating, dancing, drinking, fighting, enjoying life, and being a regular Mexican. The Mexican concept of death is exemplified in the satiric antics of the calavera and this perspective is also found in the art, literature, a     11 nd performance arts of Chicanos. Calaveras are depicted dancing, drinking in cantinas (bars), crowding and falling out of buses, and playing instruments in musical groups. El Teatro Campesino in its performances always has a calavera character that either repres     11 ents La Muerte (death) or typifies a disturbing alter ego of one of the main characters.
     12 A Mexican tradition of the late nineteenth century was the publication of a poetic broadside that was called a calavera. Published before or during the festivities of D<C3><AD>a de los Muertos, these calaveras carried poems that poked fun at socially prominent p     12 eople such as politicians and the very wealthy. Some calaveras, such as the poems, were printed in newspapers, but most were small pamphlets or single sheets that were sold on the street. For a small fee, people could hire a composer to write a calavera for them     12  and draw a skeleton to go with it. According to Tinker, <E2><80><9C>their main functions are to remind us in a good-humored way that we all are mortal, and to poke fun at friends and attack public officials. These last are supposed to take it all in good grace.     12  Calaveras are still published every November 1 in many cities of Mexico, and in some cities in Texas, notably San Antonio<E2><80><9D> (Tinker 1961, 20). The calavera is now an integral element of Mexican and Chicano folk art and it adorns murals, stationery, po     12 stcards, party invitations and decorations, and even religious art.

     15 Califas (California)
     16 An in-group name for California used continuously since at least 1940. It was originally used by the pachucos (1940s youths) in the jargon they developed in the 1930s. Los referred to Los Angeles, which was also called Losca, meaning Los Angeles, California. Bar     16 ker<E2><80><99>s glossary of pachuco words from Arizona shows that the name Califa, without the s, was used to mean a boy from California. Today, Chicanos continue to refer to Califas, when speaking of California, in an affectionate and proprietary manner. The n     16 ame can be found in art and literature as well as in academic and official documents. Not infrequently the return address on an envelope will be Califas, Aztl<C3><A1>n.

      5 Pachuco Cross
      6 A design in the form of a small cross that is tattooed on the left hand, between the thumb and forefinger, with lines, or dashes, radiating out from it. George Carpenter Barker states that it must be seven rays, or lines, that radiate from the cross. It is a wel      6 l-known symbol among Chicanos and has been traced to the era of the pachucos (1940s urban youth), hence its name. It is also known as the cruz del barrio (cross from the neighborhood) and has been found throughout major cities of the Southwest. Tattoos of Christ      6 ian images have always been popular among Chicanos, and the custom of tattooing images of Jesus Christ, crucifixes, La Virgen de Guadalupe, and other Madonnas has a long history. In the Middle Ages the Crusaders cut a cross into Chris-tian converts on the hand a      6  little above the wrist. Some social scientists believe that the pachuco cross was meant to symbolize violence and membership in a gang. But it is known that it was used as an initiation ritual among friends and peers, to show solidarity and allegiance to a part      6 icular barrio. In describing the tattooed cross Haldeen Braddy is of the opinion that each ray jetting out from the cross represented a six-month stay in jail. In his view, pachucos liked to stay in the jaula (cage, jail) so that they could <E2><80><9C>accumulat      6 e these <E2><80><98>rays<E2><80><99> as souvenirs of their imprisonment<E2><80><9D> (1971, 142). There is no evidence to support this speculation.

      8 Pachucos (-as) (1940s Urban Youth)
      9 A name adopted by Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture, detached from U.S. culture and from Mexican American urban life also. The first appearance of pachucos was in the El Paso<E2><80><93>Ju<C3>
      9 <A1>rez area during the 1920s and early 1930s. It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso. A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco. Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco. Haldeen Braddy discusses      9  the origin of the word pachuco, providing several theories. One is that the pachucos of the 1930s came from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. He also pre-sents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos, stating that pachuca      9  is a five-card poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits, or in other words, a poker hand with no value, a losing hand. Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso (1971). The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl wo      9 rd pachtli, which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on trees.
     10 Pachucos were identifiable by their clothing, hairstyles, and a distinct language with its own vocabulary. The men wore <E2><80><9C>zoot suits,<E2><80><9D> that is, pegged pants, long coats with padded shoulders, and pancake hats. Their hair was worn long and sl     10 icked back with a ducktail effect. Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants, well displayed and connected to a belt. Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos, but they also had a dress style all their own. They wore short, very tight skirts, wit     10 h their hair high and long. Makeup was heavy, especially around the eyes. Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco boyfriends.
     11 Large numbers of young men from El Paso, speaking the pachuco argot, settled in Los Angeles during the early 1940s, and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable group, and considered to be gang members. Young men who relocated and settled in L     11 os Angeles, even for short periods of time, upon returning home to the small towns of the Southwest, would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their communities. In this way pachuquesmo, a Mexican subculture, became known throughout the Southwest.
     12 The pachuco speech, a combination of English and Spanish, also called cal<C3><B3>, was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources. Cal<C3><B3> was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies, or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many langu     12 ages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings. The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon. These sources were southwestern Spanish, the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico, Mexican slang, standar     12 d Spanish from Mexico City, and also words invented by the pachucos themselves. The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment, and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso. George Carpenter Barker      12 pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated, from the 7-X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso. Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress s     12 tyle. That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources.
     13 Expressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today come from the pachuco argot of the 1940s. For example, such words as <C3><B3>rale (what<E2><80><99>s happening, or O.K.), bato (guy, as in bato loco), califas (California), hay te wuacho (I<E2><80><99>ll be seein     13 g you), and la pinta (jail/prison) have been used for generations. The film Zoot Suit, written and directed by Luis Valdez in 1981, depicts the dress, language, and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the 1940s.
     14 During the 1940s a caricature of the pachuco was created for the Mexican media in the person of Tin Tan, whose real name was Germ<C3><A1>n Vald<C3><A9>z (1919<E2><80><93>1973). He was an actor and performer who dressed as a stereotypical pachuco and zoot-suiter.     14  Tin Tan made several Mexican films portraying the Mexican American pocho who code-switches between English and Spanish, and speaks cal<C3><B3>.
     15 The pachuco was disdained in the U.S. by both the Mexican American and Anglo communities, and likewise in Mexico by the media and the intellectuals. Octavio Paz, much quoted, disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book The Labyrinth of Soli     15 tude, published in English in 1961. Although almost any urban Chicano who was young in the 1940s was affected by the style and language of the pachuco, the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy. The zoot-suit riots of 1943 are held      15 up as the epitome of the pachuco experience, totally disregarding previous and later experiences. According to Alfredo Mirand<C3><A9>, <E2><80><9C>The pachuco has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and resistance. His distinctive dress, demea     15 nor, mannerism, and language not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society. To be a chuco is to be proud, dignified, and to uphold one<E2><80><99>s personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the group. It is at o     15 nce an affirmation of one<E2><80><99>s manhood and one<E2><80><99>s culture<E2><80><9D> (1985, 179<E2><80><93>180). The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco, the cholo, and the low rider of more contemporary times.
     16 The pachuca was the counterpart of the pachuco of the 1940s but also the home-girl archetype that comes together in the young Chicana growing up in an urban ghettoized environment. During the 1940s, pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with      16 pachucos. They developed their own style of dress, wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style. Their behavior was loud and brash: they smoked cigarettes in public, wore lots of eye makeup, and supposedly were quick to      16 fight. Pachucas knew the vernacular of the times, speaking pachuco and scandalizing their families. They were not necessarily gang members, but they can be considered the precursors of present-day cholas.

In these two examples, the -N parameter simply added line numbers along the left edge of the terminal. This allows for easier navigation of the text because we can follow things based on the line number. This also makes the text more readable since there is some sort of organization to it rather than it just being a huge block of text.

### Option 2: Opening a file with less using a search term

Reference Used: [How To Geek Reference](https://www.howtogeek.com/444233/how-to-use-the-less-command-on-linux/)

If the file that we're dealing with is really big and its hard to find where things are located, we can use a specific parameter to find a keyword in the text file. Less will automatically open the text to that region with the word highlighted so that it is easier to identify it.

Large numbers of young men from El Paso, speaking the pachuco argot, settled in Los Angeles during the early 1940s, and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable group, and considered to be gang members. Young men who relocated and settled in Los Angeles, even for short periods of time, upon returning home to the small towns of the Southwest, would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their communities. In this way pachuquesmo, a Mexican subculture, became known throughout the Southwest.
The pachuco speech, a combination of English and Spanish, also called cal<C3><B3>, was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources. Cal<C3><B3> was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies, or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings. The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon. These sources were southwestern Spanish, the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico, Mexican slang, standard Spanish from Mexico City, and also words invented by the pachucos themselves. The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment, and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso. George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated, from the 7-X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso. Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style. That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources.

//Output

```
The command is also capable of telling us if the word we're looking for isn't found in the text file. When this happens, it displays an error message and then when the return key is hit, the text file is displayed as normal, without any of the words highlighted since there is no keyword.

In both these examples, using the -p parameter allowed us to try to look for the first word matching a keyword we inputted in the text file we're opening with less. If the word isn't found, less notifies us. This command makes it easy for the user to spot if a file contains a specific keyword (and where it is) when going through a text file.

The pachuco was disdained in the U.S. by both the Mexican American and Anglo communities, and likewise in Mexico by the media and the intellectuals. Octavio Paz, much quoted, disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book The Labyrinth of Solitude, pu
blished in English in 1961. Although almost any urban Chicano who was young in the 1940s was affected by the style and language of the pachuco, the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy. The zoot-suit riots of 1943 are held up as the epitom
e of the pachuco experience, totally disregarding previous and later experiences. According to Alfredo Mirand<C3><A9>, <E2><80><9C>The pachuco has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and resistance. His distinctive dress, demeanor, mannerism, and lang
uage not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society. To be a chuco is to be proud, dignified, and to uphold one<E2><80><99>s personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the group. It is at once an affirmation of one<E2>
<80><99>s manhood and one<E2><80><99>s culture<E2><80><9D> (1985, 179<E2><80><93>180). The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco, the cholo, and the low rider of more contemporary times.
The pachuca was the counterpart of the pachuco of the 1940s but also the home-girl archetype that comes together in the young Chicana growing up in an urban ghettoized environment. During the 1940s, pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with pachucos
. They developed their own style of dress, wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style. Their behavior was loud and brash: they smoked cigarettes in public, wore lots of eye makeup, and supposedly were quick to fight. Pachucas 
knew the vernacular of the times, speaking pachuco and scandalizing their families. They were not necessarily gang members, but they can be considered the precursors of present-day cholas.

Palomilla (Group of Friends)
A term used primarily in south Texas during the 1940s and 1950s to describe an informal group of guys that hung around together. Paloma means <E2><80><9C>dove,<E2><80><9D> so a palomilla is a flock of doves. One rarely hears the expression today, but it is occasionally 
used in literature, such as the short stories of Mario Suarez. A palomilla would be one<E2><80><99>s peer group, or a very close group of friends, but not a gang. Consisting of a core of three or four males, with a few fringe members, a palomilla was an important social
ization unit that provided a safe space for young men to joke and express themselves. Arthur Rubel writes about the supportive social environment provided by the palomilla of young coming-of-age Chicanos in the barrio of New Lots in south Texas. Joseph Spielberg describ
es the quick wit and aggressive bilingual humor found among the members of his palomilla during the early 1960s, and how their jostling and jesting allowed for the full bloom of each person<E2><80><99>s personality.

Papel Picado (Cut Tissue Paper)
The craft and final product of cutting out intricate designs and patterns on sheets of tissue paper. In Mexico the artists who do this work have been doing it for several generations and can cut through fifty or more sheets at a time. A pattern is made and used as the t
op sheet while the outline design is cut out with different-sized chisels. Most often the small banner-sized sheets are made to decorate altars and nacimientos (nativity scenes), or for such celebrations as Cinco de Mayo (the Fifth of May) and El Diez y Seis de Septiemb
re (the Sixteenth of September). Mexican restaurants are often decorated with streams of colorful papel picado. Some of the cutout designs are scenes related to specific holidays, such as skeletons for D<C3><AD>a de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), dancers, floral pat
terns, the Mexican flag, and other patriotic scenes. In Mexico, experienced paper cutters can make large wall hangings and tablecloths out of papel picado. Papel picado is often taught in public schools, although on the small eight-by-eleven-inch paper.

Considered the foremost scholar of Chicano folklore, Am<C3><A9>rico Paredes was a professor emeritus of English and anthropology at the University of Texas, Austin. His classic work, With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero, first published in 1958, has become a standard work in Chicano studies and American folklore. A whole generation of Chicano scholars regard Paredes as their intellectual role model and mentor, and his original research on Chicano folklore engendered a new wave of scholarship and academic achievements.

It is accepted that the word ranchera refers to a type of Mexican song, although sometimes it is an adjective that describes a character or a type of person. Ranchera comes from the word rancho, meaning a <E2><80><9C>cattle ranch, farm, or rural settlement.<E2><80><9D> 
A poor unsophisticated person may be called a ranchero or ranchera, implying he or she is from the countryside, the sticks, and a hick. In the context of Mexican folk music la canci<C3><B3>n ranchera is a love song, sung by the common folk, the peasants of the rural cou
ntryside. After the Mexican Revolution rancheras became more agreeable to the upper classes because of the movement toward a Mexican identity and nationalism and a rejection of European cultural values. The modern canci<C3><B3>n ranchera was made popular in Mexico City 
in the early 1950s by the songwriter Jos<C3><A9> Alfredo Jimenez. The poetic structure of the ranchera is brief and simple, yet emotionally it is very intense. According to Rub<C3><A9>n Campos as quoted by Gradante, <E2><80><9C>it is a moan and a sigh<C2><A0>.<C2><A0>.
<C2><A0>. , the briefest form of composition and, as such, requires a greater intensity of expression than any other compositional form. It must say precisely what it means<E2><80><9D> (1983, 105). The themes of rancheras are love and unrequited love, but from the point
 of view of the ordinary common man. Rancheras express the poetry of the masses. The famous ranchera singer Amalia Mendoza states, <E2><80><9C>the canci<C3><B3>n ranchera expresses the sensibility of the masses and reaches them: thus, its popularity.<C2><A0>.<C2><A0>.
<C2><A0>. One might say that the canci<C3><B3>n ranchera reflects the personality of the masses because it expresses something vital that we all have in common<E2><80><9D> (Gradante 1983, 105).
The ranchera originated in Mexico but is very popular in the United States among Mexicans and Chicanos. Jos<C3><A9> Alfredo Jimenez wrote over 500 songs, many becoming classics that continue to be sung today by younger artists, that have a universal sentiment that speak
s to the hearts of Chicanos. Because of the style of these romantic songs, sung to Mariachi music and sung in Spanish, untranslatable rancheras express the epitome of Mexicanness. The musical poetics arouse emotional sentiments about lost loves, nostalgia, and by extens
ion about being Mexican. Songs such as <E2><80><9C>Ella<E2><80><9D> (Her), <E2><80><9C>Camino de Guanajuato<E2><80><9D> (Road to Guanajuato), <E2><80><9C>La Vida no Vale Nada<E2><80><9D> (Life Has No Value), and <E2><80><9C>Llego Borracho el Borracho<E2><80><9D> (The Dr
unk Arrived Drunk) all elicit memories of fathers, grandfathers, and stories of Mexico. Many are drinking songs, frequently shown in movies being sung in cantinas (bars), but they are also dancing songs, so they are played at celebrations and family gatherings. Although
 rancheras are intensely male centered, there are several female singers who became famous singing rancheras, such as Lola Beltran, Lucha Villa, and Amalia Mendoza. The performance of rancheras is always dramatic and emotional, whether performed by men or women, and the
 audience can always empathize with the situations depicted in the verses. The life experiences portrayed in the songs of Jos<C3><A9> Alfredo Jimenez, who came from a poverty-stricken background himself, are about the struggles of Everyman, the need for social acceptanc
e, personal happiness, and some type of financial security. These are concerns that the average Mexicano and Chicano can identify with. Although most rancheras speak of love, other life situations found in the songs deal with fortune, destiny, and life<E2><80><99>s choi
ces. In <E2><80><9C>Camino de Guanajuato,<E2><80><9D> these existential words open the song:
No vale nada la vida,
La vida no vale nada,
Comienza siempre llorando,
Y as<C3><AD> llorando se acaba.
(Of no value is life
Life is worth nothing
It always begins with weeping
And with weeping it ends.)

social situations and entanglements he got into, were also subversively configured to emphasize the extreme illegitimacy of the social structure. His personality not only entertained but also fulfilled a seditious function, taunting the excesses of the wealthy and the absurdities of a structured social system.
Relajo can also describe a joking relationship, a bantering back and forth, which through the laughter relieves tension and disintegrates the cause of the tension of the moment. But it is the breakdown of decorum, the rejection of a social value that everyone knows is necessary, yet proscribed, that the relajo subverts. The cultural consequence is that through this type of behavior one can become temporarily free from social constraints that in daily life cannot be rejected. If one could find a phrase in English that encompasses the relajo concept, it would be <E2><80><9C>to put one over on<E2><80><9D> a system or a situation. Relajando, or echando relajo (joking), can be lighthearted joking around or can be heavy in a serious way about a grave topic.
Farr has studied the joking behavior of Mexican women in Chicago and found that through echando relajo, married and young single women find relief from their gender roles and the social propriety imposed by their husbands, parents, and the Mexican culture. Laughter created by farcical comportment, or by satire, creates an opposition to the prescribed value and to the seriousness of it. Portilla calls the shared laughing una burla colectiva (a collective joke), and states that collective laughter facilitates the collective <E2><80><9C>negaci<C3><B3>n a la conducta requerida<E2><80><9D> (negation of required conduct). Relajo can overturn values or what is assumed to be valued. El Teatro Campesino (the Farmworkers<E2><80><99> Theater) practiced the art of el relajo in the execution of its actos (dramas) and in the social protest messages propagated through satire and laughter.

The Penitentes, the ancient religious brotherhood, have attracted much research and been scrutinized by many writers and journalists. De Cordova, Henderson, Sprott, and Weigle have conducted the most perceptive and sensitive writing on the Penitentes. The popular arts of colonial New Mexico, particularly the santos and santeros, have received a lot of attention by such researchers as E. Boyd, Marta Weigle, and William Wroth.
In recent years Chicano writers from New Mexico have collected folklore from their ancestors and friends. Nasario Garcia has published several collections depicting the way of life of the elders of the Rio Puerco Valley, and Rudolfo Anaya has written several children
<E2><80><99>s books that bring forth the folklore of the region. Because of its long history New Mexico will always be a bountiful reservoir for the serious folklorist.

Nichos (Niches)
A nicho is a nook or niche built into a wall that is similar to a shelf inside of a home. It can be as small as six inches or as high as one foot or even three feet. Anything can be placed in a nicho, from books to knickknacks, but the usual purpose is to house a holy picture or statue of a saint. Consequently in some Chicano homes the word carries almost the same meaning as altar or shrine. A nicho decorated with votive candles and saints becomes the site for daily devotional prayers. Nichos are also constructed as part of yard shrines to house a favorite saint or La Virgen de Guadalupe or another Madonna. Yard shrines that incorporate a nicho are set up as a place of worship in the yard to commemorate a deceased relative or as a fulfillment of a vow. In some parts of the Southwest these outdoor shrines are also called grutas, <E2><80><9C>grottos,<E2><80><9D> and the two words are often used interchangeably. A cemetery shrine may also incorporate a nicho or a gruta. Since a gruta is primarily outdoors it can be constructed as a yard or cemetery shrine. Nichos tha

As seen in these examples, by using the -X modifier in the command, a new terminal entry is produced right under the text file upon exiting less without the file contents getting cleared. This is useful if you want to access the contents of the file when typing in your next command (maybe a file with commands?). This is also useful if you want to come back to the file you were using at a later time without having to reopen it through less again - the user will just have to scroll up.
